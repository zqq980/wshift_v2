/*  This hostile applet forges an elctronic mail letter from the person who
    views the applet in a browser to the person whose address appears in the
    string "toMe."  The return address will be listed as
    penpal@my.hostile.applet.  The appropriate commands to use for
    sendmail can be often be found in the file /etc/mail/sendmail.hf.  
    Note that while the person viewing the applet actually does initiate
    the mail by connecting (involuntarily) to port 25, the applet host's role
    in sending it is not so easily hidden.  See the full header of any e-mail
    letter sent by the applet for more details.  By putting your address
    in the string "toMe" and by scanning your incoming mail (with the
    included shell script or another of your own), you can get the full
    e-mail address, including the user name, of many people who view the
    applet. */
